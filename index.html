                <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">A: If a person passes away without a valid will, their estate is distributed according to the intestacy laws of their state. Typically, this means assets are allocated to the closest relatives, such as a spouse, children, or parents. This process can be lengthy and may not reflect the deceased's personal wishes. ​</div>

                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2', this)">Q2: How can I avoid the probate process? <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">A:To minimize or bypass probate, individuals can:

Establish a revocable living trust and transfer assets into it.

Designate beneficiaries on accounts like life insurance and retirement plans.

Hold property jointly with rights of survivorship.**</div>
            </div>

                <div id="faq3" class="faq-content">A: A will is a legal document that outlines how a person's assets should be distributed after death. It becomes effective only upon death and typically goes through probate. A trust, on the other hand, can take effect during a person's lifetime and allows for the management and distribution of assets without probate. Trusts can also provide privacy and may offer tax benefits.</div>
